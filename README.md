# VideoPreview

<h1>Objectives</h1>

<ul>Practice using <b>onmouseover</b> and <b>onmouseout</b></ul>
<ul>Practice working from an existing code base</ul>

For this assignment we'll be working with some existing code to add a video in. We'll want to find a free video that we want to work with from https://www.pexels.com/videos/.  Next we'll want to add the video into a video tag in the HTML. To make the website more interactive add hover events to play and pause the video when hovering.

<h2>Hints:</h2>

We may need to make use of the <b>.play()</b> and <b>.pause()</b> methods

We may also need the video to be <b>muted</b> as modern browsers want users to interact with (click) videos for them to start playing.
